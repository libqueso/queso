$~$\\

QUESO stands for Quantification of Uncertainty for Estimation, Simulation and Optimization and consists of 
 a collection of algorithms and C++ classes intended for
research in uncertainty quantification,
including
the solution of statistical inverse and statistical forward problems,
the validation of mathematical models under uncertainty, and
the prediction of quantities of interest from such models along with
the quantification of their uncertainties.

QUESO is designed for flexibility, portability, easy of use and
easy of extension. Its software design follows an object-oriented
approach and its code is written on C++ and over MPI. It can run over
uniprocessor or multiprocessor environments.

QUESO contains two forms of documentation:
a user's manual available in pdf format
and
a lower-level code documentation available in web based/html format.

This is the user's manual: it gives an overview of the QUESO capabilities,
provides procedures for software execution, and includes example studies.

\chapter*{Preface}
$~$\\
The QUESO project started in 2008 as part
of the efforts of the recently established Center for Predictive Engineering and Computational Sciences (PECOS)
at the Institute for Computational and Engineering Sciences (ICES) at The University of Texas at Austin.

The PECOS Center was selected by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) as one of its new five centers of excellence
under the Predictive Science Academic Alliance Program (PSAAP).
The goal of the PECOS Center is
to advance predictive science and to develop the next generation of advanced computational methods and tools
for the calculation of reliable predictions on the behavior of complex phenomena and systems (multiscale, multidisciplinary).
This objective demands a systematic, comprehensive treatment of the calibration and validation of the mathematical models involved,
as well as the quantification of the uncertainties inherent in such models.
The advancement of predictive science is essential for the application of Computational Science to the solution of realistic problems of national interest.

The QUESO library, since its first version, has been publicly released as open source
under the GNU General Public License and is available for free download world-wide.

QUESO is a collection of statistical algorithms and programming constructs supporting research into the uncertainty quantification (UQ) of models and their predictions. UQ may be a very complex and time consuming task, involving many steps: 
decide which physical model(s) to use;
decide which reference or experimental data to use;
decide which discrepancy models to use;
decide which quantity(ies) of interest (QoI) to compute; 
decide which parameters to calibrate;
perform computational runs and collect results;
analyze computational results, and eventually reiterate;
predict QoI(s) with uncertainty.

The purpose of this manual is \underline{not} to teach UQ and its methods, but rather to introduce QUESO library so it can be used as a tool to assist and facilitate the uncertainty quantification of the user's application.

Thus, the target audience of this manual is researchers who have solid background in Bayesian methods, are  comfortable with UNIX concepts and the command line, and have  knowledge of a programming language, preferably
C/C++. Bellow we suggest some useful literature:
